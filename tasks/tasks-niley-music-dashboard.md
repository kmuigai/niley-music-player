## ðŸŽ¯ **Implementation Priority (PRD-Based)**

### **Phase 1: Core MVP (Weeks 1-4)**
1. **Spotify Authentication & API Integration** - Must work with real Spotify accounts
2. **Basic AI Content Filtering** - Simple profanity filtering to start
3. **Family Account Setup** - Core family management functionality
4. **Filtered Playback** - Music that actually skips inappropriate content

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Filtering (Weeks 5-8)**
1. **Advanced AI Analysis** - Lyrics analysis, theme detection, confidence scoring
2. **Filter Level Presets** - Squeaky Clean, Family Friendly, Teen Safe
3. **Parent Dashboard** - Monitoring, controls, manual overrides
4. **PWA Features** - Offline functionality, home screen installation

### **Phase 3: Launch Ready (Weeks 9-12)**
1. **Performance Optimization** - Speed, caching, reliability
2. **User Experience Polish** - "Invisible" filtering experience
3. **Beta Testing & Feedback** - 50 family testing program
4. **Launch Preparation** - Legal, security, marketing

## ðŸš¨ **Key Risks to Address**
- **Spotify API Rate Limits** - Need intelligent caching and batch processing
- **AI Filtering Accuracy** - Conservative defaults, multiple models, user feedback
- **Lyrics Availability** - Multiple providers, safe defaults for unknown content
- **Real-time Performance** - <500ms filter decisions for good UX

The current UI foundation is just 5% of the actual product. The real work is building the AI filtering engine, Spotify integration, and family management system that makes parents feel safe playing their music around kids.
